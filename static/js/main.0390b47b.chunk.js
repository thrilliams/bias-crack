This creates a cycle of polarization: the user is fed ideologically similar content to please the reader, while hiding politically challenging ideas. Readers eventually get subdued towards extreme ends of the spectrum because they only see news that already agrees with their beliefs without opposition.\\nOur website aims to challenge people by intentionally showing some articles that the reader may dislike to expand their thinking. We abstain from algorithms that only give the reader what they want, and instead show content the reader disagrees with to challenge them."},{"id":"understanding","name":"Developing Understanding","icon":"handshake","body":"In an increasingly interconnected world, it seems like there\u2019s more division in our media than ever. News sites with clear partisan bias, people with viewpoints seemingly set in stone, and the media exacerbating it all. In this world, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in petty squabbles based purely on a lack of understanding of the other side\u2019s views.

The result is \u201cecho chambers\u201d, communities of like-minded people that reinforce their pre-existing ideas, triggering a phenomenon called confirmation bias. We aim to break down these echo chambers by presenting them with dissent in order to expose them more directly to outside viewpoints.

The result is over-simplified articles and solutions that don\u2019t address the nuances of an issue.\\nBy intentionally exposing the reader to different perspectives, we aim to break down this effect in people by showing complexities and nuances that users otherwise wouldn\u2019t see from news sources that use algorithms with the sole purpose appeasing the reader."}]')},,,,,,,function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"a":{"particles":{"number":{"value":100,"density":{"enable":true,"value_area":800}},"color":{"value":"#fbfbfb"},"shape":{"type":"circle","stroke":{"width":0,"color":"#000000"},"polygon":{"nb_sides":6},"image":{"src":"img/github.svg","width":100,"height":100}},"opacity":{"value":1,"random":false,"anim":{"enable":true,"speed":2.4775224775224776,"opacity_min":0.24775224775224775,"sync":false}},"size":{"value":3,"random":true,"anim":{"enable":true,"speed":4.795204795204795,"size_min":0.1,"sync":false}},"line_linked":{"enable":false,"distance":150,"color":"#ffffff","opacity":0.4,"width":1},"move":{"enable":true,"speed":0.5,"direction":"top","random":false,"straight":false,"out_mode":"out","bounce":false,"attract":{"enable":false,"rotateX":1,"rotateY":1}}},"interactivity":{"detect_on":"canvas","events":{"onhover":{"enable":false,"mode":"repulse"},"onclick":{"enable":false,"mode":"repulse"},"resize":true},"modes":{"grab":{"distance":400,"line_linked":{"opacity":1}},"bubble":{"distance":400,"size":40,"duration":2,"opacity":8,"speed":3},"repulse":{"distance":200,"duration":0.4},"push":{"particles_nb":4},"remove":{"particles_nb":2}}},"retina_detect":true}}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"a":[{"source":{"id":"engadget","name":"Engadget"},"author":"Jon Fingas","title":"Nearly every top-selling smartphone in 2019 was an iPhone or Galaxy - Engadget","description":"Few other phone makers got much traction outside of China.","url":"https://www.engadget.com/2020/02/29/top-selling-smartphones-2019-apple-samsung/","urlToImage":"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D1600%252C1067%252C0%252C0%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D1600%252C1067%26image_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fs.yimg.com%252Fos%252Fcreatr-uploaded-images%252F2020-02%252F5fdd99c0-5b49-11ea-bf59-786289738b03%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3D21d6bcfec659c4154a527f0c6aa42d6c9ccda455&client=amp-blogside-v2&signature=5ef16e71599a1e3e0e57a182550800c4bf1c9acb","publishedAt":"2020-03-01T03:36:02Z","content":"Just where these phones dominated is another matter.
